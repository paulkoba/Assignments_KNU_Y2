# Assignments_KNU_Y2
This repository is designated to contain Object-Oriented-Programming course assignments.

##### Lab \#1 ####
I chose to implement task \#1.4 (implement a sparse matrix) (\*\*\*) with an additional subtask 1.4.a (implement common sparse matrix operations) (\*) and task \#2.4 (find volume and surface area of a body of revolution) (\*\*\*\*\*) for a total of \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* score points.
Additionally Google Test framework was used to create tests covering basic functionality of the implemented datatypes.

##### Lab \#2 ####
I implemented task \#3 (offline file manager) using C++20 with QT framework. As such the implementation is geared towards Linux desktops with QT available. Following features were implemented:
- Ability to work on any mounted device
- Ability to restore last location after reloading the application
- Basic operations on files and directories (moving, renaming, deleting, creating, etc.)
- Permission management
- Variable default applications using xdg-open
